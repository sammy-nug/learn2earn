# **Objective:** Create a reusable prompt for text summarization.

---

# **Write a weak prompt:**
Summarize this text.

# **Refine it into a reusable pattern:** 
Summarize the following text in 3 bullet points, focusing on the main arguments and ignoring examples.

# **Test it with at least two different inputs (e.g., a news article and a technical blog).**

## Test Case 1: News Article Example

### Input (News-Style Text)

A recent government report shows that renewable energy adoption has increased by 20% over the past year. Officials attribute this growth to tax incentives and falling solar panel costs. However, experts warn that infrastructure improvements are still needed to support long-term sustainability. Critics argue that fossil fuel subsidies continue to slow the transition.

### Output Using the Refined Prompt

- Renewable energy adoption increased by 20% in the past year.  
- Growth is driven by tax incentives and lower solar panel costs.  
- Experts emphasize the need for infrastructure upgrades, while fossil fuel subsidies remain a barrier.  

✔️ Main arguments captured  
✔️ Examples and minor commentary excluded

## Test Case 2: Technical Blog Example

### Input (Technical Blog Text)

Microservices architecture allows developers to build applications as independent services that communicate via APIs. This approach improves scalability and fault isolation compared to monolithic systems. However, it introduces operational complexity, including distributed monitoring and network latency challenges. Teams must adopt automation and observability tools to manage these systems effectively.

### Output Using the Refined Prompt

- Microservices architecture structures applications as independent, API-connected services.  
- It improves scalability and fault isolation compared to monolithic systems.  
- The approach increases operational complexity, requiring automation and observability tools.
